## RandomX Features

There are lots and lots of features included in the library which is practically messy to explain all here but I will try to give you an glimpse of some of an amazing features of the **Package**.

## Complete User Details

<img src="https://github.com/josephyaduvanshi/images/blob/main/Screen%20Recording%202022-10-31%20at%2012.16.42%20AM%20(1).gif?raw=true" align = "right" height = "300px">

```dart
Row(children:[
   Text(RndX.randomCompletePersonDetails().name),
   Text(RndX.randomCompletePersonDetails().gender),
   Text(RndX.randomCompletePersonDetails().race),
   Text(RndX.randomCompletePersonDetails().religion),
   Text(RndX.randomCompletePersonDetails().birthDay),
   ++ many more....
],)
```

## Random Strings

```dart
Text(RndX.randomString(type: RandomCharStringType.alphaNumerical, length: 10)),
The parameters are type and Length which you can easily customize as per your needs.
```

## Random Credit Cards

```dart
Row(
      children: [
        Text(RndX.randomFullCreditCard().ccn),
        Text(RndX.randomFullCreditCard().expiryDate),
        Text(RndX.randomFullCreditCard().cvv),
        Text(RndX.randomFullCreditCard().cardType),

      ],
    )
```

## Random UUID

```dart
   Text(RndX.genUUID()),
```
It generated version 4 of UUID with very subtle algoritm.


## Random Name

```dart
Text(RndX.generateName()),
```

## Random Addresses

```dart
 Row(
      children: [
        Text(RndX.randomAddress().address1),
        Text(RndX.randomAddress().address2),
        Text(RndX.randomAddress().city),
        Text(RndX.randomAddress().postalCode),
        Text(RndX.randomAddress().state),
        Text(RndX.randomAddress().coordinates.lat.toString()),
        Text(RndX.randomAddress().coordinates.lng.toString()),
      ],
    );
```

You can get random USA addresses using randomAddress function and then using the same instance to access the other instances of addresses.


## Random UserAgent

```dart
Row(
      children: [
        Text(RndX.getRandomUA()),
        Text(RndX.getRandomUA(count: 4, type: UserAgentType.macOs), ),
        Text(RndX.getRandomUA(count: 4, type: UserAgentType.mobile), ),
      ],
    );
```
You can easily generate random UA with custom configuration as well as shown above, there are few more parameters more there you can explore yourselves.
